# SpeakingCards

This simple software creates random topics for speaking activities with English students. Each topic has 4 interesting questions that can spark debates between the teacher and students.

This program has been written using the FREEBASIC language, a free/open source (GPL), BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, DOS and Linux. FreeBASIC is a completely free, open-source, multi-platform BASIC compiler, with syntax similar to MS-QuickBASIC, that adds new features such as pointers, object orientation, unsigned data types, inline assembly, and many others.
